Dear Contact:
I recently learned through the University of North Texas Career Center that In Your Face Advertising
has openings in the Press and Media Relations Office. In Your Face has a long history as a
trendsetter for advertising initiatives in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and is probably best known for its
work on the TXDOT “Give 'Em a Brake" campaigns that have been modeled in the transportation
industry around the country. I am seeking a career position in a dynamic advertising environment like
that of In Your Face, and would like to introduce myself to you.
As you can see from my resume, my background is diverse and appears to meet the profile indicated
in your corporate website. I have over four years of experience in customer service, retail sales and
promotions, and event planning, and a record of achievement in my communication design degree
program. In two years at Cheddar's restaurant, I was promoted from wait staff to lead waiter then to
assistant weekend manager, and provided leadership in all aspects of customer service. I have also
prepared numerous advertising campaigns as an individual and in small groups, and have compiled a
portfolio of my advertising, which is available to you upon request.
I would like to meet with you personally to learn more about In Your Face Advertising and to discuss
career opportunities within the company. Please feel free to contact me at 000-000-0000 at your
earliest convenience. I am available for an interview immediately and will contact you in one week to
ensure you have received the enclosed information. Thank you for your time and consideration. I
look forward to meeting with you soon and discussing the exciting work you are doing at In Your Face
Advertising.
Sincerely,
Your Name
